# Statistical Analysis
In this project, we try to do a statistical analysis from the Palmer Penguin Dataset as to practice our statistical and analytical skills

# Palmer Archipelago Penguin Dataset
Palmer Archipelago (Antarctica) Penguin Dataset is a dataset collected and provided by Dr. Kristen Gorman, Palmer Station, and the Antarctica LTER (Long Term Ecological Research) Network. This dataset consists of two files in CSV format, one of which is the penguin_size dataset. The penguin_size dataset is simplified data from the original penguin dataset. This dataset is a dataset about 3 penguin species, namely the Ad√©lie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo species. Each species is determined by considering its characteristics, in the form of culmen length, culmen depth, fin length, body mass, island name, and gender. Thus, there are 6 features in this dataset with 344 rows of data.
